Write a program that asks the user to enter a year (e.g., 2024). 
Determine whether the year is a leap year using the following rules:
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
Except years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years.
Except years that are divisible by 400 are leap years.
Output a message indicating if the year is a leap year or not. For example: 

Enter year: 1600
1600 is a leap year

Enter year: 1997
1997 is not a leap year

Enter year: 2000
2000 is not leap year

Enter year: 2024 
2024 is a leap year
