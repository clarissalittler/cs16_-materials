        <main class="content">
            <p>Programming is the practice of telling a computer to do things. How the computer does things doesn't entirely matter, what you care about is describing the <em>logic</em>, the precise sequence of what steps should happen, of the program to the computer.</p>
<br>
<p>You describe this logic in a special kind of language that's suitable for explaining ideas to the computer. These <em>programming languages</em>[fn:1] are very different than human languages, focused on precision at the expense of ease and flexibility. Have you ever tried to explain to someone complicated instructions entirely through text without being able to point or gesture or demonstrate it yourself? It's not easy! Often our instructions are <em>ambiguous</em>, they're unclear or can be read in different---equally plausible---ways.</p>
<br>
<p>Programming isn't hard because programming languages are bad. Programming is hard because writing good instructions is hard and programming languages are designed to never let you write unclear instructions.</p>
<br>
<p>A good programming language is, then, a thing that lets you express instructions precisely but is still relatively easy to think-in and read.</p>
