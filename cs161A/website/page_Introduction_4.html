        <main class="content">
            <p>This is a <em>weird</em> topic to have to bring up in an introduction to computer science text, but I think it's necessary. There's a lot of talk these days about how programming will be obsolete, "English is the new programming language", &c.</p>
<br>
<p>These arguments are a little silly. Not because large language models are bad at coding---they're not---or because they're going to hit a ceiling soon---they <em>might</em> not---but rather because there will always need to be people who understand</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>what the code is doing</li>
<li>how the code does it</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>so that there are people who can guide the AI, override the AI, or decide that the task is outside the capabilities of the AI and get their hands dirty.</p>
<br>
<p>In other words, we will always need programmers. In fact, a personal prediction of the author is that the average programmer will have to be better than ever: a master of the <em>high</em> and <em>low</em> levels of programming. In a world where non-programmers can "vibe code" simple proofs of concept, there may well be even more need for competent programmers to take those simple programs and turn them into robust products.</p>
<br>
<p>By analogy, this is like how home CAD software and 3D printers didn't kill manufacturing but rather let people quickly prototype ideas that they then pay engineers to turn into production lines.</p>
