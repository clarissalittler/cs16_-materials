In this exercise, you will use loops to draw a simple ASCII-art tree. The tree should look like this:

   *
  ***
 *****
*******
   *
   *


Requirements:
- Ask the user for the height of the triangle (number of rows of leaves), and then draw the tree accordingly.
- Use nested loops: one to control the rows, and one to print the correct number of spaces and stars on each row.
- The top part of the tree (the leaves) should form a centered triangle of stars.
- The trunk should be drawn always using two rows of a single star, also centered under the tree.

Hint: use your cursor to highlight the example, and take note of the number of spaces and stars.

For example:

Enter tree height: 3
Here is your ascii tree!
