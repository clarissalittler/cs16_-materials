Write a C++ program that receives two double-precision floating-point 
values from the user. The program then should print the sum (addition), 
difference (subtraction), product (multiplication), quotient (division), 
and remainder after division (modulus). Your program must use only integers. 
A sample program run would look like (the user enters the 10 and the 2 
after the colons, and the program prints the rest):

Please enter the first number: 10
Please enter the second number: 2
10 + 2 = 12
10 - 2 = 8
10 * 2 = 20
10 / 2 = 5
10 % 2 = 0
