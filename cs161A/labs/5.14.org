All modern word processors (MS Word, Google Docs, etc) have a find and 
replace tool. Try it out before you begin. Write a program that takes 
3 strings as input: 1) an original sentence of text, 2) a word to find 
and replace, and 3) a new word to replace with. Modify the original 
sentence, then display the new sentence after the word has been replaced. 
If the word was not found, print that the word was not found. For example:

I love dogs so much!
dogs
cats
I love cats so much!

Hamsters are very cute!
Fish
Rabbits
Fish not found
