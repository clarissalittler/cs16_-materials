You are starting up a pizza business and want customers to be able
to order a pizza of any arbitrary size. For every square inch of pizza,
you will need 2.5 grams of dough, 1.2 grams of cheese and 1 gram of sauce.

Write a C++ a program that takes as input the diameter of a pizza 
in inches (double), then alculates the area of that pizza. Output the 
area of the pizza, and the amount of dough, cheese and sauce needed 
to create that pizza. Use 3.14159 as an approximation of pi.

For example:

Enter diameter of pizza in inches: 14.7
The area of your pizza is 169.7 inches squared.
You will need:
424.25 grams of dough
203.64 grams of cheese
169.7 grams of sauce.
