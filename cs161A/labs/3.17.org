Mad Libs is a word game where players are asked to fill in blanks in a 
story with specific types of words (like nouns, verbs, or adjectives) 
without knowing the full context. Once the blanks are filled, the 
completed story is read aloudâ€”usually resulting in something silly or absurd.

Write a C++ program that prompts the user for 4 strings, and outputs a
brief story including those strings. For example:

Enter a noun: octopus
Enter an adjective: clumsy
Enter a noun: radish
Enter a verb: dance
The clumsy octopus decided to dance with a radish.
