You are shopping around for that product you really want, and want to 
find the lowest price. Write a program that takes 3 prices as input, 
then calculate and display the lowest price. For example:

Enter first item's price: 72.75
Enter second item's price: 59.99
Enter third item's price: 65.00

The second item is cheapest!
