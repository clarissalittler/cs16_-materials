You and your friends want to buy pizza and need to know how many slices each 
person will get (split evenly), and how much leftovers thereâ€™ll be 
afterwards.  Write a program that receives 2 inputs: the number of 
people, and the number of pizzas to order. Calculate and display the 
number of slices each person will get, and the number of slices 
leftover. Assume a pizza has 8 slices. For example:

Enter number of people to feed: 5 
Enter number of pizzas to order: 2
Each person will get 3 slices, and there will be 1 slice leftover.
