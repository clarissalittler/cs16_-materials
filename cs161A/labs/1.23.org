Commute cost estimator

Commuting every day adds up! Write a program that does the following:

Ask the user how many miles they drive to school/work and their carâ€™s miles per gallon. 
Also ask for the current gas price per gallon.
Then, calculate the cost of their commute (both ways).
Finally, output a message with that value.

For example:
Enter the number of miles you drive to school/work: 7.0
Enter your car's miles-per-gallon: 21
Enter the current price per gallon of gas: 4.00
The cost of your commute (both ways) is: $2.66
