Write a program that asks the user to enter a student’s numeric grade (0–100). 
Using a series of if-else statements, convert the numeric grade to a 
letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the standard grading scale:
A: 90–100
B: 80–89
C: 70–79
D: 60–69
F: below 60
Then output a message indicating that letter grade. For example:

Enter your numeric grade: 87
A grade of 87 corresponds to a letter grade of B.
