It’s easy to lose track of how much you’re spending on coffee (or any other 
daily indulgence). In this program, you will build a small tool that 
helps you monitor your spending.

Requirements:
- Continuously prompt the user to enter the price of each coffee purchased.
- Use -1 as a sentinel value to stop input.
- Do not include -1 in your calculations.
- After input ends, calculate and display:
  - The total amount spent on coffee.
  - The average price per coffee.
- Format the output to two decimal places, prefixed with $.

For example:

Welcome! This tool will help you track your coffee expenses.
Enter the price of coffee (or -1 to finish): 4.50
Enter the price of coffee (or -1 to finish): 5.25
Enter the price of coffee (or -1 to finish): 4.25
Enter the price of coffee (or -1 to finish): 6.75
Enter the price of coffee (or -1 to finish): -1

Total spent on coffee: $20.75
Average price per coffee: $5.18

Goodbye!
