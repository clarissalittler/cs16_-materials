Finish this program by writing a function called swapValues() 
that swaps the values of two integers using pass by reference.

Requirements:
- The function should take two int arguments by reference.
- After calling the function, the original variables should have their values swapped.

Sample run:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 25

Before swap: a = 10, b = 25
After swap: a = 25, b = 10


~~~
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Todo: define your function here

int main(){

  int a;
  int b;

  cout << "Enter the first number: ";
  cin >> a;

  cout << "Enter the second number: ";
  cin >> b;

  cout << "Before swap: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;
  swapValues(a, b);
  cout << "After swap: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;

  return 0;
}
