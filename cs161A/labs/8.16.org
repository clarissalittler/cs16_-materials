======= meta note: ==========

idk if this one can be automated, so maybe its better for lecture rather than a lab.
not sure how to make an automation friendly lab for unit testing.

=============================


Write a function named power() that mimics the behavior of C++’s built-in pow() function.

Requirements: 
- It should take two integer arguments: a base and an exponent.
- It should return the result of raising the base to the exponent.
- It must be implemented using loops, not pow() or other math libraries.

Next, write a second function named testPower().

Requirements: 
- Create at least 4 test cases: 1 normal case, and 3 edge cases.
- Print each test using this format: 
  cout << "power(5, 3) expected: 125, got: " << power(5, 3) << endl;
- Do not return anything


Think like a tester: try to “break” your function with unexpected inputs. 
Even if your first version doesn’t handle everything perfectly, 
this process will help you see where improvements are needed.
