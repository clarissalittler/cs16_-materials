Write a program that asks the user to enter a password and uses loops to 
validate that it is strong. A strong password must:

- Be at least 8 characters long
- Contain at least one uppercase letter
- Contain at least one lowercase letter
- Contain at least one digit
- Contain at least one punctuation symbol

Use loops to scan through the string and check each requirement. 
At the end, output whether the password is strong, or list 
which requirements are missing. For example:

Enter password: iLOVEcats!2002
Your password is strong!

Enter password: forever21
Your password is missing: 
At least one uppercase character
At least one punctuation symbol
