 * 
 * In mathematics, the midpoint between the two points (x1, y1) and 
 * (x2, y2) is computed by the formula <insert formatted formula here>
 *
 * Write a C++ program that receives two mathematical points from 
 * the user and computes and prints their midpoint.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * Enter the first x coordinate: 0
 * Enter the second x coordinate: 0
 * Enter the first y coordinate: 1
 * Enter the second y coordinate: 1
 * The midpoint of (0,0) and (1,1) is (0.5,0.5)
