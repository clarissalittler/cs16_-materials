// < note: my idea here is to make 6 distinct steps, where each step is 
// evaluated before they can move on to the next>
//
// You will build a number guessing game using iterative development practices
//
// Step 1: Print “Guess the number game!”
// Step 2: Generate a random number.
// Step 3: Take one guess from the user, check if it matches.
// Step 4: Add a loop so they can guess until correct.
// Step 5: Give hints (“too high / too low”).
// Step 6: Count guesses and display at the end.
